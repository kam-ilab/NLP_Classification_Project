# NLP & Classification Project

## Project Overview

My team has been hired as data science consultants for a news outlet to create classification models using Python and deploy them as a web application with Streamlit. 
The aim is to provide a hands-on demonstration of applying machine learning techniques to natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

This end-to-end project encompasses the entire workflow:
- Data loading
- Text preprocessing
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Deployment using Streamlit

### Stakeholders
- Editorial team
- IT/Tech support
- Management
- Readers

These stakeholders are interested in improved content categorization, better operational efficiency, and an enhanced user experience.
